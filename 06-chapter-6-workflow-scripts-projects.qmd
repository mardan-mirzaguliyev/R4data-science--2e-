# Chapter 6 - Workflow: scripts and projects

## Scripts

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = class))
```

### **Running code**

```{r}
not_cancelled <- flights |> 
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), 
         !is.na(arr_delay))

not_cancelled |> 
  group_by(year, month, day) |> 
  summarize(mean = mean(dep_delay),
            .groups = "keep")
```

### **RStudio diagnostics**

```{r}
# RStudio will highlight syntax errors with a red squiggly line and a cross in the sidebar
# Hover over the cross to see what the problem is

# x y <- 
```

```{r}
# RStudio will also let you know about potential problems

# 3 == NA
```

### **Saving and naming**

1.  File names should be machine readable: avoid spaces, symbols, and special characters. Don't rely on case sensitivity to distinguish files.

2.  File names should be human readable: use file names to describe what's in the file.

3.  File names should play well with default ordering: start file names with numbers so that alphabetical sorting puts them in the order they get used.

## Projects

To real life situations, you need to make two decisions:

1.  What is the source of truth? What will you save as your lasting record of what happened?

2.  Where does your analysis live?

    ### **What is the source of truth?**

There is a great pair of keyboard shortcuts that will work together to make sure you've captured the important parts of your code in the editor:

1.  Press Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + 0/F10 to restart R.

2.  Press Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + S to re-run the current script.

### **Where does your analysis live?**

```{r}
getwd()
```

```{r}
# setwd("/path/to/my/CoolProject")
```

### **RStudio projects**

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat,
                     y = price)) +
  geom_hex()

ggsave("output/diamonds.png")
```

```{r}
write_csv(diamonds, "data/diamonds.csv")
```
